# Find Wally

This is a chrome extension that I wanted to experiment with.

What it does it random pick a word on your page to be "it". If you find it, it will be highlighted red and make a party streamer sound. :sunglasses:

Note: I set this to work only on `https://developer.chrome.com/*` and `https://support.microsoft.com/*`. I don't have intentions of testing it out on other sites, because this was just a fun POC I wanted to try out.

## Setting up

To use this chrome extension:

1. Download the files in this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser
3. At the top left corner of the page, click _Load unpacked_, then select the extension
4. Then turn on the extension!
